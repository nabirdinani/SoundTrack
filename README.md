#SoundTrack

SoundTrack is a casual top down infinite runner game with random generated obstacles. The unique mechanic for this game is the use of music. Players should put the game’s character on the correct path based on the music that is playing in their headphone. When the music is being played in the left ear the character should be on the left side of the screen, when it is being played in both ears character should be in center, and when it is being played in the right ear character should be on the right side of the screen. Changing character’s position is done by swiping left and right. This game must be played with headphones on.
